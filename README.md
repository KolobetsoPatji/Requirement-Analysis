# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains a project focused on the requirement analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Its purpose is to structure requirements for a booking management system. The work in this repository simulates real-world software planning and ensures clarity accuracy before the development stage begins.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is the systematic process of discovering, documenting, validating, and managing the needs and constraints of stakeholders for a software system. It transforms often-ambiguous business goals and user needs into clear, actionable specifications that guide design, development, and verification activities.

Key activities in requirement analysis include:
- **Elicitation:** Gathering information from stakeholders through interviews, workshops, surveys, observation, and document reviews.
- **Analysis and Modeling:** Organizing and refining gathered information into structured artifacts such as use cases, user stories, process flows, data models, and diagrams.
- **Specification and Documentation:** Writing clear, testable functional and non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and interface descriptions that become part of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
- **Validation and Verification:** Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are complete, consistent, feasible, and aligned with business objectives.
- **Prioritization and Traceability:** Ranking requirements for incremental delivery (e.g., MoSCoW) and maintaining mappings betwwen requireents, designs, and tests to track coverage and changes.

### Importance in the SDLC

Requirement analysis is foundational to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Its importance includes: 
- **Reduces rework and cost:** Clear, validated requirements prevent misunderstandings that lead to expensive rework later in the project.
- **Aligns stakeholders:** It creates a shared understanding among users, product owners, developers, and testers, ensuring the delivered product meets actual needs.
- **Improves planning and estimation:** Well-defined requirements enable more accurate effort estimates, scope control, and risk assessment.
- **Enables testability and quality assurance:** Documented acceptance criteria and traceability allow testers to verify that requirements are satisfied and to detect defects earlier.
- **Supports maintainability and scalabilty:** Requirements captured with future growth and non-functional concerns in mind produce systems that are easier to extend and operate under load.
- **Provides a clear handoff:** A complete SRS and associated diagrams (ERD, component and context diagrams, UI flows) serve as a professional handoff to design and development teams.

In short, requirement analysis turns ideas into a dependable blueprint. When done well, it makes development faster, cheaper, and more likely to succeed.
